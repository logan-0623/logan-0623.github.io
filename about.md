## Current Research

I'm currently working on **robotics and embodied AI** at SmartLab (University of Liverpool), developing gripper-aware vision-language-action policies for adaptive robotic manipulation. My research focuses on building hardware-aware multimodal systems that enable zero-shot transfer to unseen robotic tools.
