## Featured Projects

### **LeRobot SO101: Real-World Robotic Manipulation**
*Winter 2024-2025 | Jifu Medical Internship*

**🎥 Demo Video/GIF:** *[Add your robot demo here]*

Reproduced **state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms (ACT, ALOHA)** on real hardware from scratch. Built a complete teleoperation pipeline with dual-camera synchronization for robotic manipulation tasks.

**What I Built:**
- ✅ Dual-arm leader-follower teleoperation system
- ✅ Multi-camera synchronization (front + wrist views)
- ✅ Data collection pipeline → HuggingFace Dataset
- ✅ Real-time robotic control with 30Hz control loop
- ✅ Collected **50+ demonstration episodes** for policy learning

**Technical Highlights:**
- Integrated **LeRobot framework** with SO101 arms
- Implemented **camera calibration** and synchronized recording
- Built **dataset preprocessing** for policy training
- Hands-on experience with **real-robot deployment**

**Tech Stack:** Python · PyTorch · LeRobot · OpenCV · HuggingFace · ROS

### **Wheel-Legged Robot: From Math to Motion**
*Winter 2024-2025 | Independent Project*

**🎥 Demo Video/GIF:** *[Add your self-balancing robot demo here]*

Built a **self-balancing wheel-legged robot from scratch** — from mathematical modeling to real-world deployment. This project demonstrates strong foundations in **robot kinematics, control theory, and embedded systems**.

**What I Built:**
- ✅ Complete **inverse kinematics solver** for 5-link leg mechanism
- ✅ **Cascaded PID control** (speed loop + angle loop) for wheel balancing
- ✅ **IMU-based attitude estimation** and sensor fusion
- ✅ Real-time control implementation in **C++/Arduino**
- ✅ RC teleoperation with **multi-modal control** (wheel + leg stabilization)

**Why This Matters:**
- Proves understanding of **robot kinematics** (forward/inverse)
- Shows mastery of **PID control** and feedback systems
- Demonstrates **hardware-software integration** skills
- Evidence of **hands-on engineering ability** (not just Python!)

**Tech Stack:** C++ · Arduino · ESP32 · PID Control · IMU · Servo Motors · BLDC

## Additional Projects

### **Academic Website with Interactive Features**
*Fall 2024*

Personal homepage built with **Jekyll** featuring parallax effects, theme switching, and responsive design.

**Tech Stack:** Jekyll · HTML/CSS · JavaScript · GitHub Pages
