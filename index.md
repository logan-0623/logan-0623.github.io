## Welcome to My Academic Homepage

I am a Computing Science student at the University of Liverpool, passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and medical image analysis.

I will graduate in July 2026 and am actively seeking **Fall 2026 PhD or Research Assistant positions** in **Human–Computer Interaction and Multimodal AI**, with a particular focus on **interaction modeling, intelligent medical interfaces, and cross-modal perception systems**. 

My recent projects explore the intersection of AI and interaction, including prior-guided segmentation models and multi-modal medical imaging frameworks. Building on my experience in medical imaging, multimodal learning, and real-time robotic systems, I aim to integrate AI-driven perception with interactive platforms to enable explainable, efficient, and clinically applicable solutions.

I am now actively seeking **Fall 2026 PhD or Research Assistant positions** in **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on multimodal learning, cross-modal perception, and interaction modeling, where I aim to integrate AI-driven perception with intelligent systems for medical and real-world applications.
