# How to Add a Favicon

Your website currently doesn't have a favicon (the small icon that appears in browser tabs).

## Quick Steps to Add Favicon:

### Option 1: Use Online Generator (Recommended)
1. Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple design with your initials "ZL" or "ZHL"
3. Download the generated files
4. Copy `favicon.ico` to the root directory of your website

### Option 2: Use Your Photo
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your profile photo
3. Download the generated favicon package
4. Copy `favicon.ico` to the root directory

### After Adding the Favicon:
The favicon should automatically appear. Jekyll/GitHub Pages will serve it from the root directory.

## Recommended Design Ideas:
- Simple text: "ZL" or "Z" in a professional font
- Color scheme: Blue/Navy (academic feel)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at 16x16px

## File Location:
Place the `favicon.ico` file at: `/Users/loganluo/Loganweb/favicon.ico`
